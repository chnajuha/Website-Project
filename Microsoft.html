                <li><a href="media/Microsoft/microsoft1.png"><img src="media/Microsoft/microsoft1.png" width="300" alt="Microsoft has reported a revenue of $23.3 billion for its most recent fiscal quarter, a 13 percent year-over-year increase, for a total net income of $21.2 billion in its 2017 fiscal year, which ended in June. 
                LinkedIn contributed $1.1 billion to revenue during Q4, $125,000 more than it did in Q3, the first quarter LinkedIn showed up in Microsoft’s reports. Gaming revenue went up by 3 percent as Xbox sales remained strong post-E3.
                Q4 was another strong quarter for cloud services, as it has historically been over the past year. Revenue in this category was up by 15 percent year over year, driven by Azure’s growth of 97 percent. One particularly big win for Microsoft is from its Office segment, which is now seeing more revenue from subscriptions than from its traditional licensing model. 
                While Office revenue is only up 5 percent overall, the milestone shows Microsoft successfully transitioning to a new, and likely more lucrative, business model.
                However, Microsoft Surface revenue dropped 2 percent, and the company attributes it to “product lifecycle transitions.” The new Surface Laptop and Surface Pro, which were announced on May 2nd and May 25th, respectively, have been only been available since June 15th, meaning the late arrivals did little to penetrate Surface sales this quarter.
                “We delivered a strong finish to the year with 30 percent growth in commercial bookings this quarter,” said Amy Hood, executive vice president and chief financial officer at Microsoft in a press release."

                <li><a href="media/Microsoft/microsoft2.png"><img src="media/Microsoft/microsoft2.png" width="300" alt="Microsoft has released Seeing AI — a smartphone app that uses computer vision to describe the world for the visually impaired. With the app downloaded, the users can point their phone’s camera at a person and it’ll say who they are and how they’re feeling. They can also point it at a product and it’ll tell them what it is. 
                All of this is done using artificial intelligence that runs locally on their phone. The company showed off a prototype of Seeing AI in March last year at its Build conference, but starting today, the app is available to download for free in the US on iOS. However, there’s no word yet on when it’ll come to Android or other countries.
                The app works in a number of scenarios. As well as recognizing people it’s seen before and guessing strangers’ age and emotion, it can identify household products by scanning barcodes. It also reads and scan documents, and recognizes US currency. This last function is a good example of how useful it can be. As all dollar bills are the same size and color regardless of value, spotting the difference can be difficult or even impossible for the visually impaired. 
                An app like Seeing AI helps them find that information. The app uses neural networks to identify the world around it, the same basic technology that’s being deployed all over Silicon Valley, powering self-driving cars, drones, and more. The app’s most basic functions are carried out directly on the device itself. This means they can be accessed more quickly and in situations where there’s no stable internet connection. 
                However, Seeing AI’s experimental features — like describing an entire scene or recognizing handwriting — require a connection to the cloud. Speaking to The Verge at a Microsoft event in London, Saqib Shaikh, the tech lead on Seeing AI, said he most commonly used the app for reading documents like signs and menus. 
                He points out the app doesn’t just perform the basic task of optical character recognition technology, but also directs the user — telling them to move the camera left or right to get the target in shot. Shaikh says that the difference between this and similar apps is the speed of the neural nets: “One of the things we wanted to do was face recognition on device, and we’ve done that so within a few milliseconds you’ll hear the result. It’s all about the speed, and we try to do as much as we can on the device.”"

                <li><a href="media/Microsoft/microsoft3.png"><img src="media/Microsoft/microsoft3.png" width="300" alt="Microsoft issued a “highly unusual” patch for Windows XP last month to help prevent the spread of the massive WannaCry malware. At least 75,000 computers in 99 countries were affected by the malware which encrypts a computer and demands a $300 ransom before unlocking it. Microsoft stopped supporting Windows XP in April 2014, but the software giant is now taking the unprecedented move of including it in the company’s Patch Tuesday round of security updates today.
                “In reviewing the updates for this month, some vulnerabilities were identified that pose elevated risk of cyberattacks by government organizations, sometimes referred to as nation-state actors, or other copycat organizations,” says Adrienne Hall, general manager of crisis management at Microsoft. “To address this risk, today we are providing additional security updates along with our regular Update Tuesday service. These security updates are being made available to all customers, including those using older versions of Windows.”
                Microsoft says it is releasing updates for Windows XP, Windows Vista, and all other more recent unsupported and supported versions of Windows due to an “elevated risk” of attacks that are similar to the WannaCry malware. The patches will be made available on Microsoft’s Download Center or Windows Update. Microsoft says this move to release security updates for platforms not in extended support “should not be viewed as a departure from our standard servicing policies,” and that this is an exception based on intelligence that led it to believe government organizations may use these new vulnerabilities to attack Windows systems.
                Microsoft isn’t explaining who or what has tipped the company off to these potential new attacks. March’s security patches included fixes for hacking tools that were leaked from the NSA, and Microsoft didn’t acknowledge the source of the security flaw reports then either. There has been speculation that The Shadow Brokers, a group that leaked the NSA exploits, tipped Microsoft in advance to the previous exploits. Microsoft also mysteriously delayed its Patch Tuesday release in February by a month in an unprecedented move, blaming a 'last minute issue'.
                If you're still running Windows XP then these new patches should be installed immediately, even though Windows XP wasn't as badly affected by the first WannaCry attacks. While almost all WannaCry victims were running Windows 7 without the latest security updates, it's not clear if these new attacks might target Windows XP more aggressively this time around."

                <li><a href="media/Microsoft/microsoft4.png"><img src="media/Microsoft/microsoft4.png" width="300" alt="Microsoft is releasing a new test version of Windows 10, build number 16215, today and there are a lot of changes on the way. If you’re a Windows Insider on the Fast Ring then it’s available immediately, for everyone else all of the new features will arrive in the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update later this year.
                The first big change is a new look for the notification center (Action Center), which has been redesigned with separate sections for apps. It certainly looks a lot better, and groups notifications together in a more coherent way from devices, apps, and elsewhere.
                You’ll now be able to pin your favorite websites to the taskbar in this latest Windows 10 update. Of course, once they’re pinned they’ll open in Microsoft’s Edge browser, but the pinned sites feature is returning after feedback from Windows 10 users. Microsoft is also improving the animations for new tabs in Edge, making things a little faster. 
                Cortana will also see some changes, with the ability for the digital assistant to prompt for reminders by scanning images (with your permission) for things like events. If you’ve taken a photo of a poster, Cortana can then create that reminder. Cortana also has a new lasso feature that lets stylus users circle content to create reminders for things like movies.
                Perhaps the biggest changes Microsoft is focusing on are with Windows 10 stylus support. The handwriting panel has been overhauled with more gestures, better editing, emoji, and automatic handwriting detection. As you write with a pen words are automatically converted to text, and words will shift along so you can simply keep writing. You can also select text to edit it, and make corrections to converted text using ink gestures. 
                You can strikethrough, scratch, join, or split with the gestures, and the handwriting panel also includes quick access to emoji and symbols. The handwriting panel will float by default now next to where you’re writing, and you can even use the stylus to scroll in apps and websites now. Microsoft has even added a “find my pen” option, that will show where you were with your device when you last used the pen.
                Elsewhere, Microsoft is finally making it easy to insert emoji into emails or social media messages. A new winkey + period / semicolon keyboard shortcut will trigger a new emoji panel where you can pick the most appropriate emoji for your messages. Microsoft is also adding a new touch keyboard for Windows 10 desktop and tablet users, with prediction, emoji suggestions, one-handed input, and shape writing with your fingers or a stylus. Dictation has also been added to the keyboard, so you can dictate text or use it for basic editing commands. Dictation has been in Windows for years, but it’s encouraging to see Microsoft move this to an area that makes more sense.
                Alongside these bigger changes there are some smaller tweaks to Windows 10 overall. A new copy link feature in the new share page makes it easy to share links, and there’s improved support for HDR monitors and the ability to easily switch between public and private for network connections. There’s a lot of other minor changes and fixes listed in Microsoft's huge blog post, and all will be welcomed by regular Windows 10 users. This is one of the bigger feature additions to Windows 10 preview builds for a few months now as Microsoft heads towards a September release for the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update."
