                <li><a href="../media/Apple/apple1.png"><img src="../media/Apple/apple1.png" width="300" alt="After years of near-silence, Apple is slowly starting to make a bit of noise about its work on artificial intelligence. Last December the iPhone maker shared its first public research paper on the topic; this June it announced new tools to speed up machine learning on the iPhone; and today it started blogging. Sort of.
                The company’s new website, titled “Apple Machine Learning Journal,” is a bit grander than a blog. But it looks like it will have the same basic function: keeping readers up to date in a relatively accessible manner. “Here, you can read posts written by Apple engineers about their work using machine learning technologies,” says the opening post, before inviting feedback from researchers, students, and developers.
                As the perennial question for bloggers goes, however: what’s the point? What are you trying to achieve? The answer is familiar: Apple wants more attention.
                It’s clear that the recent focus on AI in the world of tech hasn’t been kind to the iPhone maker. The company is perceived as lagging behind competitors like Google and Facebook, both in terms of attracting talent and shipping products. Other tech companies regularly publish new and exciting research, which makes headlines and gets researchers excited to work for them. Starting a blog doesn’t do much to counter the tide of new work coming out of somewhere like DeepMind, but it is another small step into public life. 
                Notably, at the bottom of Apple’s new blog, prominently displayed, is a link to the company’s jobs site, encouraging readers to apply now.
                What’s most interesting, though, is the blog’s actual content. The first post (actually a re-post of the paper the company published last December, but with simpler language) deals with one of the core weaknesses of Apple’s AI approach: its lack of data.
                Much of contemporary AI’s prowess stems from its ability to sieve patterns out of huge stacks of digital information. Companies like Google, Amazon, and Facebook have access to a lot of user data, but Apple, with its philosophy of not snooping on customers — in favor of charging megabucks for hardware — has rather tied its hands in that regard. The first post on its machine learning blog offers a small riposte, describing a method of creating synthetic images that can be used to train facial recognition systems. 
                It’s not ground-breaking, but it’s oddly symbolic of what needs to be Apple’s approach to AI. Probably a blog worth following then."

                <li><a href="../media/Apple/apple2.png"><img src="../media/Apple/apple2.png" width="300" alt="Do you use Apple products? Do you like emoji? Do you want more emoji? If you answered yes to those questions, then good news: Apple announced today that it’ll be adding new emoji to its iOS, macOS, and watchOS platforms later this year. It showed off a few of the new characters in celebration of “World Emoji Day,” which I adamantly refuse to acknowledge as a real thing.
                The new emoji appear to be Apple’s take on the most recent Unicode 10 standard, which, among other things, added 56 new emoji to the lexicon. Those emoji include soon-to-be classics like the “Exploding Head,” “Crazy Face,” “Face With Monocle,” and “Sandwich” emoji, along with an oddly long list of fantasy-themed emoji. (Was anyone really asking for Mage, Fairy, Vampire, Merperson, Elf, Genie, and Zombie emoji?)
                If any of this sounds familiar, that’s because Unicode 10 was officially released by the Unicode Consortium earlier this year on June 20th. But Unicode just decides what the new emoji and text characters are. It’s then up to manufacturers to create and release designs for the emoji (like Google’s blobs) on their own, which usually takes a few months after the standard is announced. That largely depends on the company, however: the Android O beta, for example, already has the new emoji available to use.
                Apple hasn’t said when the new emoji will be released, but it seems likely that they’ll be packaged into the iOS 11 and macOS High Sierra updates scheduled for this fall."

                <li><a href="../media/Apple/apple3.png"><img src="../media/Apple/apple3.png" width="300" alt="Recording phone calls on an iPhone can be a pain. You either have to pay for an app that probably only works through a custom dialer (or the phone app, which doesn’t help if you need to make a call through WhatsApp, Skype, or a different service), or you end up using a tape recorder or another phone to record the call over speaker. But PhotoFast is attempting to fix this problem with its Call Recorder adapter.
                The Call Recorder plugs into the Lighting port on your iPhone and can record calls made on the device through services like Skype, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Line, Viber, and WeChat. The device uses .m4a format for the recordings, and you can choose to save the files to your local storage or a microSD card.
                For incoming calls, there is a record button directly on the Call Recorder which will automatically start a recording once you press it. It also comes with a 3.5mm headphone jack, so it can double as an adapter. The PhotoFast Call Recorder is available through Indiegogo’s product marketplace — which is for products that are already shipping — for $125. Shipping is expected to take one to two weeks."

                <li><a href="../media/Apple/apple4.png"><img src="../media/Apple/apple4.png" width="300" alt="Apple has reportedly extended the service policy on first-generation Apple Watches for three extra years from the original purchase date. Apple technicians will now repair your Apple Watch for free if the device’s back cover separates from the watch body, according to MacRumors. 
                The issue has been publicized on various forums, like Reddit, although apparently Apple is keeping this service policy extension pretty quiet and only told technicians about it through an internal memo. The service policy change affects any model of the first-generation watch, including the Sport and Hermès versions.
                The company already extended the watch’s service policy for a separate issue: swollen and expanded batteries that caused the display to protrude. Again, Apple kept the extension secret and only publicized it through a memo. Basically, if your Apple Watch is experiencing some odd hardware issues, make sure you ask about a free repair."
