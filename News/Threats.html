                <li><a href="../media/Threats/threats1.jpg"><img src="../media/Threats/threats1.jpg" width="300" alt="Scammers are increasingly abusing consumer awareness of sites that encrypt data sent over the internet using HTTPS, particularly through a spike in phishing attacks that hope to win the confidence of victims by using the protocol on spoofed sites.
                “For quite a while now, the security community has been educating users about the importance of secured communication. Users have been taught that important connections will be secured with HTTPS,” wrote Anna Shirokova and Ivan Nikolaev, researchers with the Cisco Talos team, who Thursday explained the HTTPS phishing problem in a report.
                Raised awareness has created a “strange side-effect” where consumers trust anything secured with HTTPS, they said, adding that trust is increasingly being abused by scammers especially through phishing attacks.
                “During our analysis, we have observed domains being used for phishing, as well as by scammers, offering fake technical support and by advertisers promoting products of questionable quality,” they wrote.
                Attackers are impersonating well-known domains such as Apple.com, Facebook.com, Microsoft.com and PayPal.com, and sign phony sites they use as phishing domains, such as apple.com-133[.]com and facebook.com-secured[.]com, with legitimate certificates.
                “This means that the users who visit the domain and look at the URL will see the little green lock. Rarely will anyone check the actual certificate,” Shirokova and Nikolaev said.
                Phishing emails often link to spoofed sites, and when they are viewed in a mobile browser or inside a narrow browser window, often the only thing the target sees is HTTPS in the URL and the first half of a spoofed domain such as Microsoft.com-pl-lot1[.]oficjalne-prezenty-gadzet[.]top.
                Researchers said attackers are taking advantage of certificate authorities such as Let’s Encrypt which provides certificates for free, no questions asked.
                “We acknowledge there is a problem here, but the solutions are not very clear cut,” said Josh Aas, the executive director of Let’s Encrypt in an interview with Threatpost. He points out that Let’s Encrypt’s primary mission is to prevent surveillance and censorship on the web.
                Aas said, certificate authorities should not subjectively prohibit domains from getting certificates because it would be essentially censoring the web as HTTPS becomes more mandatory.
                Phishing sites abusing SSL and TLS certificates is nothing new. Last month, a report by The SSL Store said last year 15,270 free SSL certificates were issued to sites that contained the word “PayPal” in the domain name or the certificate identity. It claimed 97 percent were issued to phishing sites.
                “The crux of the problem is this green lock and what people think it means. It means the connection is encrypted, not that the content of the site is safe,” Aas said. “Browsers are over-promising. What we need is content awareness.”
                For now, the best course of action, according to Aas, is to rely on frameworks such as Google Safe Browsing and Microsoft Smartscreen becasue they have the ability to block sites reported to them as unsafe."

                <li><a href="../media/Threats/threats2.jpg"><img src="../media/Threats/threats2.jpg" width="300" alt="A vulnerability in Google’s Chrome browser allows hackers to automatically download a malicious file onto a victim’s PC that could be used to steal credentials and launch SMB relay attacks.
                Bosko Stankovic, information security engineer at DefenseCode, found the flaw in the default configuration of the latest version of Chrome running on an updated version of Microsoft’s Windows 10 operating system.
                “Currently, the attacker just needs to entice the victim (using fully updated Google Chrome and Windows) to visit his website to be able to proceed and reuse victim’s authentication credentials,” he wrote Monday in a description of the vulnerability.
                The technique allows an attacker to gain access to a victim’s username and Microsoft LAN Manager (NTLMv2) password hash. That leaves victims open to a variety of attacks including a Server Message Block (SMB) relay attack. A SMB relay attack allows an adversary to use a victim’s credentials to authenticate to a PC or network resource such as email or remote server.
                Attacks could also use this vulnerability to attempt to crack the target’s hashed password.
                DefenseCode said it did not notify Google of the vulnerability. When Threatpost asked Google to comment a spokesperson said “We’re aware of this and taking the necessary actions.” Google didn’t elaborate.
                According to Stankovic the browser attack is simple.
                First, a victim is enticed to click on a specially crafted link that triggers an automatic download of a Windows Explorer Shell Command File or SCF file (.scf) onto a victim’s PC. The file is automatically downloaded to the target’s C:\Users\%Username%\Downloads Folder.
                Once the .SCF file is downloaded into the Download directory it lays dormant. However, once the user opens the Download directory folder in Windows, the SCF file tries to retrieve data associated with a Windows icon located on the attacker’s server.
                When the SCF file attempts to retrieve the remote icon file data it present the attacker’s server with the victim’s username and hashed version of the victim’s password. If the victim is part of a corporate network, the username and password is the network username and password assigned to the victim by the company’s system administrator. If the victim is a home user, the SCF file will request the icon data associated with the home user’s Windows username and password.
                Researchers independent of DefenseCode point out that the vulnerability is not exclusively tied to the way the Chrome browser handles SCF files, but also the way Windows handles them as well.
                According to Stankovic, SCF files are lesser known file types going back as far as Windows 98 where it was primarily used as a “Show Desktop” shortcut. “It is essentially a text file with sections that determine a command to be run (limited to running Explorer and toggling Desktop) and an icon file location,” Stankovic said.
                Researchers say this type of attack could be used maliciously to attempt to crack the hashed password. The attacker could also use the credential request in a SMB relay attack. Under that scenario an attacker could forward the credential request to attempt access NTLM-enabled services on a corporate network – such as email or network access.
                “Organizations that allow remote access to services such as Microsoft Exchange (Outlook Anywhere) and use NTLM as authentication method, may be vulnerable to SMB relay attacks, allowing the attacker to impersonate the victim, accessing data and systems without having to crack the password,” Stankovic said.
                To protect against the attack in Google Chrome, DefenseCode recommends visiting Settings> Show advanced settings> and Check the “Ask where to save each file before downloading” option."

                <li><a href="../media/Threats/threats3.jpg"><img src="../media/Threats/threats3.jpg" width="300" alt="A family of Android malware was so successful that at its peak, over the course of two months last year, it infected 14 million devices and rooted more than half of them, roughly eight million devices.
                Researchers said early Tuesday the strain of malware, dubbed CopyCat, helped its authors earn $1.5 million – primarily through ad fraud – from April to May 2016.
                Researchers with Check Point’s Mobile Research Team, who found the malware in March this year, claim CopyCat mostly infected Android users in Southeast Asia, but that upwards to 280,000 U.S. Android users were also infected. According researchers, Asia accounted for 55 percent of CopyCat infections. Africa, at 18 percent, accounted for the second highest number of infected devices.
                The malware never made it to Google’s Play marketplace, but did spread via popular apps, which were repackaged with CopyCat and available for download on third-party app stores.
                The malware lingers until the infected device is restarted; once that happens, it downloads a series of exploits from an Amazon S3 bucket and attempts to root the device.
                “If successful, CopyCat installs another component to the device’s system directory, an activity which requires root permissions, and establishes persistency, making it difficult to remove,” the researchers wrote Thursday.
                Once in, the malware targets Zygote, an Android core process that launches apps and if exploited, essentially grants attackers admin privileges.
                Triada, an Android Trojan uncovered by Kaspersky Lab, and later by Check Point in 2016, previously used this technique. Kaspersky Lab’s Anton Kivva, a malware analyst with the company, said in June that year Triada was infecting Zygote, obtaining super-user privileges, and using Linux debugging tools to embed a malicious DLL to target mobile browsers.
                Researchers at Check Point claim that with the CopyCat malware, attackers have taken a shine to injecting code into the Zygote process to get credit for fraudulently installed apps on the device by swapping out referrer IDs for legitimate apps with their own. The malware also displays fake ads and installs fake apps, two additional methods of generating capital for the attacker.
                Researchers were able to get a better idea exactly what attackers were doing to victim’s devices by looking through one of the malware’s command-and-control servers. Daniel Padon, a mobile threat researcher with Check Point told Threatpost Thursday researchers have the data from a C+C going back more than a year. Between April and May 3.8 million of the devices were being served fake ads while 4.4 million other devices were being used to steal credit for installing apps on Google Play, the firm claims.
                The bulk of the exploits CopyCat used to root the eight million devices are years old, according to Check Point. Four of them were from 2014, one was even from 2013, suggesting victims either didn’t patch their devices, or patched infrequently.
                One of the exploits, Towelroot (CVE-2014-3153) was behind a scourge of auto-rooting malware this time last summer and a wave of Android ransomware attacks in April of that year that targeted outdated systems.
                Researchers are unclear who exactly is behind CopyCat but note there are several connections to MobiSummer, an ad network based in China. It’s possible the attackers simply used the network’s code and infrastructure however.
                Check Point says Google, which it informed of CopyCat in March – shortly after it discovered the malware – has been able to “quell the campaign” over the past year.
                When reached by Threatpost on Thursday a spokesperson for Google said the company has been familiar with CopyCat – malware it says is a variant of a larger, undisclosed malware family its monitored since 2015.
                “Each time a new variant appears, we update our detection systems to protect our users. Play Protect secures users from the family, and any apps that may have been infected with CopyCat were not distributed via Play. As always, we appreciate researchers’ efforts to help keep users safe,” Google said.
                Google introduced Play Protect, a service that scans previously downloaded apps to ensure they’re safe from malicious components, in May at Google I/O.
                Padon told Threatpost the malware demonstrated a number of new techniques, and that as far as he knew, wasn’t connected to another family.
                “We didn’t manage to affiliate this malware with any other known family,” Padon said, “It also presents a lot of new techniques which were never seen before. If Google does come up with a name it will be interesting to know.”
                CopyCat joins the ranks of other Android malware strains previously discovered by Check Point, like HummingBad and Gooligan. Gooligan was blamed for the breach of 1 million Google accounts this past December. HummingBad, disclosed by the firm last July, reportedly raked in $300,000 a month for its authors via adfraud. Both families of malware installed adware on infected handsets in order to generate revenue."

                <li><a href="../media/Threats/threats4.jpg"><img src="../media/Threats/threats4.jpg" width="300" alt="Tens of millions of products ranging from airport surveillance cameras, sensors, networking equipment and IoT devices are vulnerable to a flaw that allows attackers to remotely gain control over devices or crash them.
                The vulnerability, dubbed Devil’s Ivy, was identified by ​researchers at Senrio, who singled out high-end security cameras manufactured by Axis Communications. Senrio said 249 models of 251 Axis cameras are vulnerable to unauthenticated remote attackers who can intercept a video feed, reboot cameras, or pause a video feed while conducting a crime.
                Researchers said Axis Communications isn’t alone, reporting 34 companies use the same underlying flawed software; including Microsoft, IBM, Xerox and Adobe. Those companies are part of the ONVIF Forum, an unofficial international consortium of hardware vendors.
                Researchers believe bad code used in a software library responsible for the bug originated from the ONVIF Forum, which is responsible for maintaining software and networking protocols used by members. “While forums like ONVIF serve a useful purpose when it comes to issues of cost, efficiency, and interoperability, it is important to remember that code reuse is vulnerability reuse,” researchers said.
                The vulnerability is in the communication layer of a software library used in those devices called gSOAP, which is a widely used web services development tool for XML enabling devices to talk to the internet, researchers wrote on a technical blog explaining the vulnerability on Tuesday. Approximately six percent of the forum members use gSOAP, Senrio said.
                The vulnerability allows a remote adversary to flood the targeted device over port 80 with data and create a simple buffer overflow attack. Next, researchers say, the adversary can send a specially crafted payload of data that allows a remote unauthenticated user to execute code on vulnerable devices.
                “In the case of this camera, in order to exploit the vulnerability you would need to send a malicious payload to port 80. The camera then processes the data using the vulnerable library. The attacker then sends the specially crafted payload that triggers the buffer stack overflow which leads to custom code execution,” said M. Carlton, VP of research with Senrio, in an interview with Threatpost.
                Once the attacker executes code on the device, they have the ability to reset the firmware back to device’s factory defaults. From there, they can change the passwords or network settings, Carlton said. The attack works on vulnerable devices, despite the use of complex passwords. Michael Tanji, COO and cofounder of Senrio, told Threatpost that the attack generally should sound alarm bells because of the large volume of traffic sent to cameras and IoT devices when attacks take place.
                “In the security cameras that we looked at, this library this is a big problem. With some other security devices and other general applications of gSOAP it may not be as big of a problem,” Tanji said. “We just don’t know, because we haven’t done the extensive research.” Tanji said that it privately disclosed the vulnerability in May and waited until Axis and Genivia deployed a patch before publicly disclosing the flaw on Tuesday. A scan of the internet using Shodan had revealed 14,700 of Axis’s cameras vulnerable to Devil’s Ivy. Senrio recommends patching, but also keeping security devices off the public internet and behind a firewall.
                “Devil’s Ivy highlights the industry’s growing concern with the security of IoT.  We forget or don’t realize that many of the devices we use everyday are computers— from the stoplight at your street corner to the Fitbit you wear on your wrist — and therefore are just as, if not more, vulnerable as the PC you sit in front of everyday,” researchers said.
                Repositories hosted with ONVIF Forum and at places such as GitHub, Bitbucket and NuGet Gallery are essential tools helping developers find pre-existing code that adds functionality for their software projects without having to reinvent the wheel. However, security experts have long warned the amount of insecure software tied to reused third-party libraries is staggering. In an analysis of 25,000 applications, researchers at Sonatype found that seven percent of components had at least one security defect tied to the use of an insecure software component."
