                The app first began offering a comment filter last September, but it was a very simple approach: Instagram would only remove comments that contained words and phrases it had specifically identified as offensive. (Users could also add their own custom banned phrases.)
                Now, the system is getting a lot smarter. It uses machine learning to identify comments that seem offensive, giving the system some ability to take into account the reply’s context, potentially catching more bad comments and cutting down on false positives at the same time. 
                Wired has a big story on how the system was made, and it mentions that when a comment gets flagged, it’ll be blocked for everyone — except the person who wrote it, so they won’t know their remark didn’t get through.
                One other notable change here: Instagram is turning the offensive comment filter on by default, whereas the earlier filter had to be enabled. You’ll still be given the option to turn it off from inside the app’s settings, and Instagram still includes the ability to block custom words and phrases.
                The filter only works in English at launch, but Instagram says it’s working to expand it to other languages “over time.”
                Instagram is also announcing an AI spam-filtering system today, too. The spam filter has secretly been in place since last October, but it’s only being revealed today. Given that no one has noticed it in the past nine months, the filter probably isn’t blocking too many comments that it shouldn’t. 
                That filter is active in nine languages, including English. (As a side note: Instagram really needs a better system for blocking spam accounts, as well. I set my profile to private recently in order to cut down on spam followers, but now I’m just getting follow requests from spam accounts instead.)"

                <li><a href="media/Apps/apps2.png"><img src="media/Apps/apps2.png" width="300" alt="The most exciting thing about Apple’s recent announcement of iOS 11 at WWDC, to me, was ARKit. The idea that augmented reality is going to be baked into the mobile operating system means all sorts of weird stuff is on the way this fall. 
                If, like me, you’re anxious to play around with AR, but you also don’t want to burden your iPhone with a buggy developer beta version of iOS 11, a new app called Holo is almost good enough to scratch that itch. Holo was created by a VR / AR company called 8i, which we actually profiled back in February. It’s a simple app that lets you place “holograms” — essentially animated 3D models of people or animals — in your world using your iPhone’s screen as a viewfinder. 
                There’s a burgeoning “store” inside the app where you can download different 3D objects, but they’re all either people or animals at the moment. There’s a skateboarder, a dancing wrestler, a few different versions of Spider-Man (sponsored by Marvel, of course), and for those of you clamoring for topical augmented reality, a fake Donald Trump.
                But there are problems with Holo’s simplicity. For one, the objects can’t interact with the world you’re placing them into. The app isn’t recognizing surfaces or mapping the world, it’s just remembering generally where you placed the object so that if you turn away or move around, the hologram stays relatively put.
                This is fine if you’re placing things in an open area, but it means the app isn’t aware of walls or other things in the real world that might block your view of the object. For instance, I put Spider-Man in my coffee mug, but when I pulled the phone away from the top, he stayed visible. When I placed him in my shower and walked out of the bathroom, he appeared in the hallway when I turned back in that same general direction.
                Another frustrating side effect of Holo’s simplicity is that the app is sparse, almost too much so. There are buttons at the bottom for recording a video and taking a photo, but to get to the tray of holograms, you have to swipe up over that same area. When the tray of holograms — which is laid out in a row of circles like Snapchat’s lenses — is there, you swipe up to see the hologram “store” or down to bring the camera controls back. It’s just confusing to have all these controls competing against each other in the same spot.
                All this said, if you use it right and work around these limitations, Holo can be fun. The struggles are almost worth it for the times where the AR looks just right, because those moments can still wow you (and others) a bit. And to be fair, 8i already built a version of Holo for Tango, Google’s AR platform, so there’s a good chance the experience will improve when ARKit goes live.
                Really though, this is all just a tease for what’s to come with augmented reality on iOS 11. And while developers have already been experimenting with some wild ideas using ARKit that put 8i’s version here to shame, I do believe the Holo app is a pretty good blueprint for what most consumers’ initial experience with augmented reality will look like on iOS 11: an app with a camera-style interface that has its own “store” full of 3D models, objects, and effects.
                Holo is available today for free on both iOS and Android."

                <li><a href="media/Apps/apps3.png"><img src="media/Apps/apps3.png" width="300" alt="Current is a new startup that wants to take allowances into the modern age through an app-controlled Visa debit card, via TechCrunch. It’s a clever idea at its core: credit cards are more prevalent than ever these days, and this is a way for parents to help kids safely learn how to use them, which isn’t a bad thing.
                Current allows parents set up both recurring allowances for kids or one-time batches of money, and it gives plenty of control when it comes to things like shutting off the card and blocking groups of retailers (like bars or hotels) or specific stores. And both parents and kids will be able track their spending in the current app, which could help with teaching lessons like financial responsibility.
                There are some other nice features built into Current, too. Parents can assign chores to kids with monetary rewards through the app, and kids can easily donate money to charities if they’d like to. Current also offers an option to round up purchases to a dollar amount, depositing the extra in a savings wallet.
                Of course, nothing in life is free: Current costs $5 a month, with discounted options of $36 paid annually, or $48 paid biannually for those willing to make a long-term commitment."

                Olli is a new photo and video filter app from Tinrocket (which has released a number of similar products) that gets around my inability to draw by turning my selfies and snack pictures into seemingly hand-drawn works of art.
                It’s a nice effect when used for still images, but it’s not really something that we haven’t seen before from other filter apps. But where Olli stands out from apps like Prisma is the fact that it applies the effects in real time, which means you can preview shots and even use it for video. I’m particularly fond of the Salt filter, which turns simple stills and clips into what feels like an animated comic. 
                In playing around with the app for a few minutes, I found that Olli gave the best result from subjects that had interesting and clearly defined patterns — something more vague, like my face, didn’t translate nearly as well to the illustrated effect.
                In terms of app UX, Olli is just really nicely designed. Switches from the camera to selecting filters can be done with a quick swipe, clips can be edited and converted to GIFs or Live Photos, and it’s easy to export finished pictures and videos to services like Instagram straight from the app.
                The biggest issue with Olli is the price. While it won’t breaking the bank at $2.99, it’s still pricier than the usual “free” that many photo-filtering apps go for. Tinrocket also sells additional filter packs on top of the bundled seven (although a Cinema pack, which includes an additional four filters, is currently offered for free). 
                That said, the effects are look pretty impressive, and if you’re looking for a fun way to make some unique-looking videos or Instagram pictures, there are worse ways to spend $3."
